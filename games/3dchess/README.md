# CSS 3D Chess Board Model with Pieces ♟️

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/ShadowShahriar/pen/JjXaOqe](https://codepen.io/ShadowShahriar/pen/JjXaOqe).

> **Heads up!** This CodePen demo was created a long time ago by an ameteur web developer (me!) So, chances are some features will not work as intended. The Chessboard model is built with **533 DIVs**, and it shouldn't be viewed in mobile devices.

**BACKSTORY**

In my first month on Tech Twitter, I was blessed to be able to meet some great people. One of them was [**Hasan** (@hasan_py)](https://twitter.com/hasan_py). Knew he likes to play chess! So, as soon as [**I learned about his birthday**](https://twitter.com/hasan_py/status/1306481953084899330), I started building this Chessboard model.

Ah, it was a pleasure to make him a birthday present!

**FUN FACTS**

-   While working on this project, I got interested in learning chess and started practicing daily. Before that, I only knew how to pronounce _chess_

-   Someone on Twitter [asked me](https://twitter.com/thisisatefe/status/1488791570539323394) whether I wanted to make a game out of this chessboard model. Sounded like a fun task for my future self.
